### crossover (simplistic)  
    -simple R script demonstrating, 0/1/2 recombinations per chromosome  
    
### assumptions  
 - probabilities for 0/1/2 recombination ==> c(0.10,0.75,0.20)  
 - recombination can happen anywhere on the chromosome with equal Probability  
 - does not use mapping functions (no Kosambi or haldane)
 - assumes no mutation
 - no recombination hotspots

### input  
 - Haplotypes (Paternal and maternal haplotype)
